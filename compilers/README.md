# Pipeline Framework Compilers
This directory contains the compiler code for each supported pipeline framework. To add support for a new pipeline framework, create a Docker image that executes a Python module implementing the standardized compiler interface described below.

The following should be added to all Dockerfiles:

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=base-common resources/compile.sh compiler/compile.sh
COPY --from=base-common resources/entrypoint.sh entrypoint.sh

USER 65534:65534
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Compiler Interface
### Input
The compile argo workflow will always execute `/compile.sh` passing in the following arguments:

* `--pipeline_config` is the path to the yaml file that contains the pipeline resource definition.
* `--output_file` is the path to output the compiled pipeline definition to.

The Python module is required to be named `compiler`. The entry point to the Python compiler module should accept (or ignore these) parameters.

Suggestion would be to match the interface defined in the TFX compiler:

```python
    @click.command()
    @click.option('--pipeline_config', help='Pipeline configuration in yaml format', required=True)
    @click.option('--output_file', help='Output file path', required=True)
    def compile(pipeline_config: str, output_file: str):
```

### Output

All compilers must output the following standardized JSON/YAML structure to ensure compatibility with the KFP Operator and supported providers. 

This standardized structure should be written to the output file defined in `--output_file`, should contain a wrapped pipeline specification, and match the following format:

```json
{
  "displayName": "pipeline-name",
  "labels": {},
  "pipelineSpec": {
    // Raw pipeline specification from the framework (KFP, TFX, etc.)
    "schemaVersion": "2.1.0",
    "sdkVersion": "kfp-2.13.0",
    // ... rest of pipeline spec
  },
  "runtimeConfig": {}
}
```

#### Required Fields

- **`displayName`**: Human-readable name of the pipeline (usually extracted from `--pipeline_config`).
- **`labels`**: Key-value pairs for metadata and categorization (can be empty).
- **`pipelineSpec`**: The raw pipeline specification as generated by the framework.
- **`runtimeConfig`**: Runtime configuration (can be empty).

Note that these fields are based on the output from TFX's `KubeflowV2DagRunner`. Therefore the [TFX compiler](compilers/tfx/compiler/compiler.py) simply uses the same output, whereas the KFP SDK wraps the output from `kfp.compiler.Compiler().compile()` to match this format.

This standardized format ensures that the KFP Operator and provider services can consistently process pipeline definitions regardless of the underlying framework.
