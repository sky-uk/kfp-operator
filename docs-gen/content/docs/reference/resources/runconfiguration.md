The RunConfiguration resource represents the lifecycle of Recurring Runs (aka Jobs) on Kubeflow Pipelines.
Pipeline training runs can be configured using this resource as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: pipelines.kubeflow.org/v1alpha2
kind: RunConfiguration
metadata:
    name: penguin-pipeline-recurring-run
spec:
    pipeline: penguin-pipeline:v1-abcdef
    experimentName: penguin-experiment
    schedule: '0 0 * * * *'
    runtimeParameters:
        TRAINING_RUNS: 100
```

## Fields
